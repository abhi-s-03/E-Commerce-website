## How it Works?

### Project Overview
ArtMart is an e-commerce website designed for buying and selling art products online. Users are required to log in to access the full functionality of the platform.

### User Interface and Navigation
#### Categories
The website covers five main categories of art products: Paintings, Sculptures, Digital Art, Photography, and Handicrafts. Users can explore these categories to find their desired products.

#### Search and Filters
A search bar in the header allows users to search for specific products. Additionally, filters such as Price, Customer Ratings, Discount Rate, and Availability enhance the search experience.

### Product Details
#### Individual Product Page
Clicking on a product opens an individual page displaying detailed information about the chosen item. Users can find an 'Add to Cart' and 'Buy Now' option on this page.

### Shopping Cart
#### Cart Summary
The Cart section provides a summary of the products added, allowing users to adjust quantities. A billing summary, including Subtotal, Shipping Charges, and Total Amount, is visible in the cart.

#### Checkout
From the Cart page, users can proceed to checkout. Here, they enter address information and choose a payment method before finalizing their purchase.

## Seller Features
#### Seller Dashboard
For sellers, a dedicated Seller Dashboard is available. It includes an Artwork Management section displaying all products under 'My Products,' where sellers can edit or delete existing items and add new products.

#### Other Sections
The Seller Dashboard also comprises sections for managing orders, viewing the seller's profile, and checking earnings summaries.

### Additional Information
#### Contact and Footer
Contact information and other details are provided in the footer section of the website for users to access additional information.
